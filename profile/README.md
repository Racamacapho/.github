## Design principles
Every decent design system starts with design principles. Here are ours:
### 1. Inclusion and accessibility first 
### 2. Progressively enhanced
### 3. Fault-tolerant
### 4. Heavily documented and tested

It is not headless, it's head-full. Design tokens rule the UI and developers include designers into their sandbox, not the other way around.
